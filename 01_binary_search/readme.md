# **Binary Search**
***Simple Search***: 
<br/>       Maximum number of steps to search an expected value: n
<br/>       Time complexity: O(n)

***Binary Search***: 
<br/>       Maximum number of steps to search an expected value: log n 
<br/>       Time complexity: O(log n)

Binary Search works only on a ***sorted list***.

Binary Search is also called a Half-Interval Search, Logarithmic Search, Binary Chop Search
